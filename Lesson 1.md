**Here's a kind of the recup what I've learnt during our last lesson.

  

The lesson was about [[Git]].

  

Git is a kind of tool, software which is a distributed version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in any set of computer files.

  

Firstly, I had to install this software on my computer. To do that I opened google browser and I found the Git website from where I could download it. It is available for free. I chose the latest version and the downloading started automatically.

  

Then I got to know that this system uses commands, and that Git VCS allows me to create repositories. Each repository is a kind of library where all my file changes will be stored.Â 

  

First, I made a folder (= directory) on my "D" disc partition. I called it "GIT". Next I found out that there is a website where I can find references on how to do what I want to do when it comes to Git VCS. I found a command which allows me to create a new, empty repository.**
