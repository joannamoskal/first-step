During the meeting I had the chance to learn some new commands useful for working with Git.  Because of the fact that I have my Git on another partition in my computer, I always have to change the directory. To do that I can use the command which I wrote about in Git basics file but there is a shorter way to open Git in the proper partition. It's:

*cmd*

which we have to write  in the correct place ( where I have my repository on my computer)  and then we have to press the enter key. After that I immediately have the correct window opened.

Another interesting thing I heard about was that Git can have two different windows, it may be visible as a window terminal or bash. 

In Git Bash we can change our directory via using the following commands:

*cd D:/* 

and then to move to the proper folder ( in my case it’s called DEF) we put the following command:

*cd DEF/*

It is worth signing that we can use the up arrow key on our keyboard to call off the last command we used.
  
The command which allows me to change the window and exactly means the Git graphical repository browser is:

*gitk* 

After using this command we can see changes in a repository or a selected set of commits. This includes visualizing the commit graph, showing information related to each commit, and the files in the trees of each version.
